# GridPane Manager Backend API

Apple-friendly, App Store-compliant backend service for the GridPane Manager iOS app. This Node.js API handles all privileged server operations, monitoring, and notifications without requiring direct SSH access from the mobile app.

**ðŸš€ MAJOR UPDATE:** Upgraded from Python Flask to Node.js Express for better iOS integration, enhanced security, and improved performance.

## Features

- **System Metrics**: CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, network statistics
- **Service Control**: Restart services (nginx, MySQL, PHP-FPM) via GridPane CLI
- **Cache Management**: Clear site and server-wide cache using GridPane tools
- **REST API**: Secure JWT-authenticated endpoints for iOS app integration
- **GridPane Integration**: Uses official GridPane CLI commands for all operations
- **Systemd Service**: Runs as a background service with automatic startup
- **Real-time Monitoring**: WebSocket support for live metrics (planned)
- **Push Notifications**: Server alerts and status updates (planned)
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource footprint with Node.js efficiency

## Installation

### Automatic Installation

Run the installation script on your GridPane server:

```bash
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/HollerDigital/holler-server-monitoring-agent.git
cd holler-server-monitoring-agent
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Manual Installation

1. Install Node.js 18.x LTS:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   ```

2. Create service user and directories:
   ```bash
   sudo useradd --system --shell /bin/false gridpane-manager
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/gridpane-manager /var/log/gridpane-manager /etc/gridpane-manager
   ```

3. Copy application files and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo cp -r . /opt/gridpane-manager/
   cd /opt/gridpane-manager
   sudo -u gridpane-manager npm install --production
   ```

4. Configure environment and start service:
   ```bash
   sudo cp .env.example /etc/gridpane-manager/.env
   sudo systemctl enable gridpane-manager
   sudo systemctl start gridpane-manager
   ```

## Configuration

The backend service runs on port 3000 by default and uses API key authentication for all endpoints except health checks. Configuration is managed through environment variables in `/etc/gridpane-manager/.env`.

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production

# Authentication
API_KEY=your-secure-api-key-here

# GridPane Integration
GRIDPANE_CLI_PATH=/usr/local/bin/gp

# Monitoring
METRICS_INTERVAL=30000
ALERT_THRESHOLDS_CPU=80
ALERT_THRESHOLDS_MEMORY=85
ALERT_THRESHOLDS_DISK=90

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info
LOG_DIR=/var/log/gridpane-manager
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
The API uses API key authentication. Include the API key in the `X-API-Key` header for all requests except health checks.

### Health Check (No Auth Required)
```bash
curl https://your-server.com/health
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-04T21:43:15.669Z",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "service": "GridPane Manager Backend API"
}
```

### System Metrics (API Key Required)
```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://your-server.com/api/metrics
```

Response format:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-04T17:30:00Z",
  "cpu": {
    "usage": 15.2,
    "cores": 4
  },
  "memory": {

    "avg1": 0.5,
    "avg5": 0.8,
    "avg15": 1.2
  },

}
```

### Service Control (API Key Required)
All service control operations use GridPane CLI commands for proper system integration.

```bash
# Restart nginx using GridPane CLI
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://your-server.com/api/control/restart/nginx

# Restart MySQL using GridPane CLI
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://your-server.com/api/control/restart/mysql

# Restart entire server (requires confirmation)
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"confirm": "yes"}' \
  https://your-server.com/api/control/restart/server
```

Response format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Nginx restarted successfully using GridPane CLI",
  "output": "nginx: configuration file test successful\nnginx restarted",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-04T21:40:42.381Z"
}
```

### Cache Management (API Key Required)
Cache management uses GridPane CLI commands for proper integration.

```bash
# Clear all caches using GridPane CLI
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://your-server.com/api/control/cache/clear

# Clear specific site cache
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"site": "example.com"}' \
  https://your-server.com/api/control/cache/clear-site
```

Response format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Cache cleared successfully",
  "output": "Redis Cache cleared\nPHP OpCache cleared\nNginx FastCGI Cache cleared",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-04T21:16:27.461Z"
}
```

## Service Management

```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status gridpane-manager

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u gridpane-manager -f

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart gridpane-manager

# Stop service
sudo systemctl stop gridpane-manager
```

## Uninstallation

To remove the backend service:

```bash
# Stop and disable service
sudo systemctl stop gridpane-manager
sudo systemctl disable gridpane-manager

# Remove service files
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/gridpane-manager.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Remove application files
sudo rm -rf /opt/gridpane-manager
sudo rm -rf /var/log/gridpane-manager
sudo rm -rf /etc/gridpane-manager

# Remove service user
sudo userdel gridpane-manager
```

## GridPane CLI Integration

This backend service integrates directly with GridPane CLI commands for all system operations, ensuring compatibility with GridPane's security model and best practices.

### Service Management
- **Nginx restart**: Uses `gp ngx -restart` command
- **MySQL restart**: Uses `gp mysql -restart` command
- **Cache clearing**: Uses `gp fix cached` command
- **Site-specific cache**: Uses `gp site {site} cache clear` command

### System User Requirements
For optimal GridPane CLI integration, the backend service should run as root or a properly configured GridPane system user with SSH access enabled:

```bash
# Enable SSH access for a system user (run as root)
gp user {username} -ssh-access true
```
